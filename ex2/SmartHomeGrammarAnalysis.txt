SMART HOME GRAMMAR ANALYSIS

1. POTENTIAL AMBIGUITIES:

The grammar may have the following ambiguities:

a) Room name ambiguity: In phrases like "Turn on the living room light", it may be unclear whether "living room" is a single room name or whether "living" is modifying "room". Our grammar resolves this by defining ROOM_NAME as a capitalized word pattern, which helps distinguish it.

b) Preposition usage: The same preposition could have different meanings in different contexts. For example, "to" in "Set the temperature to 24" indicates a target value, while in other contexts it might indicate direction.

c) Implied objects: Commands like "Turn on the light" vs "Turn on" might be ambiguous if the device object is optional. Our grammar requires a device object to avoid this issue.

d) Time format confusion: For time values, users might enter "18:00" or "6:00 PM". The grammar currently only supports 24-hour format with no AM/PM indicator.

2. PARSE TREE STRUCTURE EXPLANATION:

For the example "Turn on the kitchen light":

The parse tree starts with a root node labeled "command". Since this is a simple command, it branches to a "simpleCommand" node, which then has three child nodes: "action", "deviceObject", and an optional "modifier" (not present in this example). The "action" node contains "Turn" as the VERB and "on" as the PREPOSITION. The "deviceObject" branches to a "lightDevice" node, which contains the tokens "the", "kitchen" (as ROOM_NAME), and "light". This hierarchical structure clearly delineates the verb phrase that describes what to do (Turn on) from the noun phrase that describes what to control (the kitchen light).

3. SAMPLE INPUTS AND EXPECTED OUTPUTS:

Sample Input 1: "Turn on the Kitchen light"
- Parses as a simpleCommand
- action: VERB="Turn" PREPOSITION="on"
- deviceObject → lightDevice: "the" ROOM_NAME="Kitchen" "light"
- No modifier present

Sample Input 2: "Increase brightness by 10"
- Parses as a simpleCommand
- action: VERB="Increase" (no preposition)
- deviceObject → brightnessDevice: "brightness"
- modifier: "by" INT="10"

Sample Input 3: "If the time is after 22:30 then turn off the Living Room light"
- Parses as a conditionalCommand
- condition → timeCondition: "the time is after" time="22:30"
- simpleCommand:
  - action: VERB="turn" PREPOSITION="off"
  - deviceObject → lightDevice: "the" ROOM_NAME="Living Room" "light"
  - No modifier present

[Note: For the hand-drawn parse tree required in the submission, you would need to manually create this based on the structure described above for one of these examples.]
